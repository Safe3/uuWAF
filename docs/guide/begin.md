# Usage

After the previous installation and configuration, you can now start using it



##  :beginner: Prepare <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
?> If you are not familiar with the UUSEC WAF yet, it is recommended to read [it](/api/README) first.



##  :computer: Management <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

?> Open browser https://127.0.0.1:4443/ , Default username: admin, password: Passw0rd!

!> Attention: After logging in, please promptly create a new administrator user whose username is difficult to guess, delete the default admin user, and enable dynamic passwords to ensure the security of WAF management backend accounts. Due to the use of the more secure HMAC-SHA256 algorithm for OTP, which is not compatible with general OTP clients, it is recommended that iOS users use [Google Authenticator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605), android users using [FreeOTP](https://waf.uusec.com/freeotp.apk).
